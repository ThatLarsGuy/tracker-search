Tracker-Search Extension for Gnome-Shell

Version: 1.5.1


This is a version of the tracker-search extension, specifically crafted for for Gnome 3.4.

Source of this fork: https://github.com/cewee/tracker-search
Gnome extension page: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/284/tracker-search/

The latest version of this extension stopped working Gnome 3.4 and failed to return any results.  This version is based on an older version of tracker-search that did work under Gnome 3.4, but with some newer changes merged in to provide keyboard navigation of the search results, and some CSS changes so that the search results highlight properly on mouse-over and focus.


There are two versions of the CSS provided:

stylesheet.css / stylesheet.css.default-theme
The default CSS from cewee, with highlighting for focus/mouse-over

stylesheet.css.darkshine-theme
A modified CSS that matches better with the Gnome 3 'Dark Shine' theme (which I use)

You can rename the CSS file locally to use the one you prefer, after the extension is installed under:
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tracker-search@cewee
(Gnome Shell requires a restart for the CSS change to take effect)
